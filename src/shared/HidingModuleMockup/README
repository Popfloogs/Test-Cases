This module is a quick mockup of a hiding functionality module meant to 
eliminate remote events from the current server and client hiding scripts
Furthermore, the modules offer chained functionality that requires the client only
to interact with the prox prompt and nothing more (removes countdown scripts). 
All else is handled through the modules.\\

Possibility of expanding this to handle even more functionality including
sanity checks (communications between server and seperate modules). 

Example: 
Hiding spot checks, such as:
    start : 
        if player is already hiding in the spot
        if player is in cooldown
        if player is seeker

    end   : 
        if player leaving spot is correct player 

can be moved to seperate modules that can be called first to return bool values
before proceeding to call the hidingFuncs.Hide() function and place the player in
the spot. 

Example module script:]]
    function hideFuncs.Check(plr, spot)
        local checksBool = false
        if plr.backpack.seekerVal == false then
            if plr.backpack.hideCoolDown == false then
                if spot.hidingPlayerBool == false then
                    checksBool = true
                    return checksBool
                end
            end
        end
    end

            


--Example piece of prox prompt code:
--...
    hideSanity = hideFuncs.Check(plr, spot)
    if hideSanity == true then
        hideFuncs.Hide(plr, spot)
    end
