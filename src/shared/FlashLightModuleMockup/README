Module for flashlight control and checks. Certain portions were not fully used in current
game state. This is a mock up because, other than FLAdd and FLRemove, the rest of this 
code has not been implemented or tested as of yet. 

FLRemove works as the transfer of the flashlight between current seeker and the tagged, new seeker.
FLRemove also handles the transfer of the already cloned light from a storage folder to the new seeker.
Instead of generating a new clone.

FLAdd is only called within the modules as a failsafe for if the seeker is not assigned a light.

FLSeeker is the initial seeker selection at game start up. This clones the first light from Replicated storage.

FLSanity is run periodically throughout play just as a check to ensure the light has been assigned. If no light has been assigned
a new clone is created and a new seeker is selected adding the newly cloned light to their pack.
